# Interactive Dashboards with App live data
The ultimate goal of this project is to get a pipeline that requests live data from the server, aggregates it and pushes the results on a website / git repo / app so that the users and interested people can always have a look on the live data.
As the connection to a frozen view of the TYT database is already established, we start with the TYT project.
